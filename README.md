# playertest

simple player testing pygame project thing

## Dependencies

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [`pygame-ce`](https://pyga.me/)

> [!NOTE]
> It's recommended to use `pygame-ce` because of the refresh rate feature, but feel free to use normal [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) if you have to.

## How to run

### All

The command should be as simple as something like this:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

Or you can do this if your OS supports it.

```bash
./main.py
```

<!-- If you lack basic reading comprehension skills --> If you don't understand this, it's just opening the script in Python, or more specifically, Python 3.
